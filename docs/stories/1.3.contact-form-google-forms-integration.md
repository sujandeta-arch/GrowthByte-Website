# User Story: Contact Form Google Forms Integration (Quick Solution)

**Story ID:** 1.3  
**Priority:** 🔴 URGENT  
**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Assigned:** Bhargav  
**Created:** 2024

---

## Story Description

As a **website visitor**, I want to **submit the contact form and receive confirmation**, so that I know my inquiry was received and the GrowthByte team can follow up with me.

As a **GrowthByte team member**, I want to **receive contact form submissions via email and have them stored automatically**, so that I can respond to potential clients promptly without any backend development.

---

## Business Context

Currently, the contact form on `/contact` page does not persist or send data anywhere. When users submit the form, their information is lost. This is a critical gap preventing lead capture and customer communication.

**Decision:** Use Google Forms as a **quick, zero-backend solution** to get contact form working immediately.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Replace Contact Form with Google Forms

**Action:** Replace the current contact form on `/contact` page with an embedded Google Form

**Form Fields Required:**
- Full Name (required)
- Email Address (required)
- Company Name (required)
- Service Interest (required - dropdown/select)
- Phone Number (optional)
- Message/Goals (optional - long text)

**User Experience:**
- Form should be embedded directly in the `/contact` page (not a link-out)
- Form should be responsive and work on mobile devices
- Form should maintain professional appearance (as much as possible with Google Forms)

---

### 2. Email Notifications to GrowthByte Team

**When:** User submits Google Form

**Action:** Google Forms automatically sends email notification

**Email Details:**
- **To:** `harsha@thinkbyte.ai`
- **From:** Google Forms (automated)
- **Subject:** New response in [Form Name]
- **Body:** Includes all form responses

**Configuration Required:**
- Set up email notifications in Google Forms settings
- Add `harsha@thinkbyte.ai` as notification recipient

---

### 3. Auto-Reply to User

**When:** User successfully submits Google Form

**Action:** Google Forms automatically sends confirmation email to submitter

**Email Details:**
- **From:** Google Forms (automated)
- **To:** User's email address (from form)
- **Subject:** Your response has been recorded
- **Body:** Google Forms default confirmation message

**Note:** This will be from Google, not `info@growthbyte.ai`. This is acceptable for the quick solution.

---

### 4. Data Storage

**Action:** All form submissions automatically saved to Google Sheets

**Benefits:**
- All submissions stored in one place
- Easy to export, analyze, or integrate with other tools
- No database setup required
- Historical data preserved

---

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Approach

1. **Create Google Form:**
   - Go to Google Forms (forms.google.com)
   - Create new form with required fields matching current contact form
   - Configure form settings:
     - Enable "Collect email addresses"
     - Enable "Send respondents a copy of their response"
     - Set up email notifications to `harsha@thinkbyte.ai`
     - Link to Google Sheet for data storage

2. **Get Embed Code:**
   - In Google Forms, click "Send" button
   - Select "Embed HTML" tab
   - Copy the iframe embed code

3. **Update Contact Page:**
   - File: `app/contact/page.tsx`
   - Replace current form HTML with Google Forms embed
   - Use iframe to embed the form
   - Ensure responsive styling (iframe should be responsive)

4. **Styling Considerations:**
   - Google Forms has limited customization
   - Can adjust iframe width/height
   - May need to hide Google branding if possible (check Google Forms settings)
   - Ensure form fits within existing page design

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Google Form

1. Go to https://forms.google.com
2. Create new blank form
3. **Form Title:** "Get In Touch"
4. **Form Description:** Add the following text in the form description field:

```

We're here to help you transform your marketing with AI + human expertise. Whether you need SEO, PPC, social media, email marketing, or a full-funnel strategy, let's discuss how we can help you achieve exponential growth.
```

5. Add form fields matching current contact form:
   - **Short answer:** Full Name (required)
   - **Short answer:** Email Address (required, with email validation)
   - **Short answer:** Company Name (required)
   - **Dropdown:** Service Interest (required)
     - Options: Marketing Strategy, SEO, PPC, Social Media, Email Marketing, Content & Design, Full-Funnel Marketing
   - **Short answer:** Phone Number (optional)
   - **Paragraph:** Message/Goals (optional)
6. **Custom Confirmation Message:** In form settings → Presentation, set custom confirmation message:

```

We've received your message and will get back to you within 24 hours. In the meantime, check your email for a confirmation of your submission.

If you have any urgent questions, feel free to reach us directly at harsha@thinkbyte.ai or +91-8904879011.

```

7. Customize form theme (orange/black to match GrowthByte branding if possible)
8. In form settings:
   - Enable "Collect email addresses"
   - Enable "Send respondents a copy of their response"
   - Set up email notifications

### Step 2: Configure Email Notifications

1. In Google Forms, click the three dots (⋮) → Settings
2. Go to "Responses" tab
3. Enable "Get email notifications for new responses"
4. Add `harsha@thinkbyte.ai` as notification recipient
5. Save settings

### Step 3: Link to Google Sheet (Optional but Recommended)

1. In Google Forms, click "Responses" tab
2. Click the Google Sheets icon to create linked spreadsheet
3. All responses will automatically populate in the sheet

### Step 4: Get Embed Code

1. Click "Send" button in Google Forms
2. Click the "Embed HTML" icon (</>)
3. Adjust width/height if needed (recommended: width="100%" height="800px")
4. Copy the iframe code

### Step 5: Update Contact Page

Replace the form section in `app/contact/page.tsx` with the Google Forms embed code.

**Actual iframe code to use:**
```tsx
<div className="bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-xl p-8 md:p-12 mb-16 border border-gray-100">
  <iframe
    src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc--kgQvA_2Tj8OHfKqCbZVif89LDQazVexHReZ3mbfmkfsZw/viewform?embedded=true"
    width="100%"
    height="1624"
    frameBorder="0"
    marginHeight={0}
    marginWidth={0}
    className="w-full"
    title="Contact GrowthByte"
  >
    Loading…
  </iframe>
</div>
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Replace the existing `<form>` element in `app/contact/page.tsx` with the iframe code above
- The iframe width is set to `100%` for responsiveness
- Height is set to `1624px` (from Google Forms embed code) - adjust if needed
- The `title` attribute is added for accessibility
